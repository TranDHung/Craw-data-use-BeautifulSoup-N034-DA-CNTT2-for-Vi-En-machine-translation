When I was a kid , I thought North-North Korea was the best country in the world , and I used to sing the song &quot; We have nothing to be jealous of . &quot;
I was so proud of my country .
At school , we spent a lot of time learning about the life of president Kim II- Sung , but didn &apos;t learn much about the outside world , except that the United States , South Korea and Japan were our enemies .
Although I used to wonder not how the world was out there , I still think I would live my whole life in North-North Korea , until all of it suddenly changed .
When I got to 7 , I witnessed people openly firing for the first time in my life , but I still think my life here is perfectly normal .
My family was not poor , and I myself had never suffered from hunger .
But on one day in 1995 , my mother brought home a letter from a sister who worked in the same place as her mother .
It reads : When she read these lines , then my whole family of five was no longer on this lifeline , because the whole house of me had nothing to eat for two weeks .
All lying on the floor , and our bodies getting weak could feel like death was coming very close .
I was shocked .
Because it was the first time I knew that my fellow citizens were suffering like that .
Not long after that , as I passed a station , I saw a horrifying sight I could never forget .
On the platform of the station was the dead body of a woman with two hands still holding a gaping baby , and the baby just stared into its mother &apos;s face .
But there &apos;s no one to help them , because they &apos;re all having to care for themselves and their whole families .
In the mid- &apos; 90s , North Korea experienced a severe famine .
It caused over a million North Koreans to die of hunger , and many who survived only ate grass , bugs and bark .
The power outages were happening more and more often , so everything around me was in the dark when the night came except the light from the Chinese side just a river away from my house .
I was wondering all the time why they had electricity and we didn &apos;t .
This is a picture from a satellite of North Korea at night in comparison with surrounding countries .
This is the Pearl River it &apos;s the natural border between North Korea and China .
It &apos;s possible to see that the river bed has a very narrow section , so some North Koreans secretly cross into China .
But so many people died .
And I saw their bodies floating in the river .
I can &apos;t say specifically how I fled North Korea , can only say that in the years of misery caused by her famine I was sent to China to live with a distant relative .
At that time , I just thought I was going to have to stay away from my family for a short time .
chứ never could I imagine that I would have to be 14 years away from them .
In China , it &apos;s very difficult for a girl who is isolated from her family like me to live in isolation .
I hadn &apos;t imagined what it would be like to live a refugee from North Korea , but I soon realized that it wasn &apos;t only very difficult , it was incredibly dangerous , as refugees from North Korea entering China were treated as illegal immigrants .
I have always lived in a constant fear that my identity would be discovered , and that I would be returned to my old life in North Korea .
One day , that nightmare came true , I was arrested by Chinese police and taken to a police station for questioning .
Somebody informed them that I was North Korean , so they tested my Chinese ability and asked me a lot of questions .
I was terrified , and it felt like my heart was about to explode .
For if as they saw there was anything unnatural , I would be put in jail and then returned home .
I thought my life coming here was ending , but I still tried to control my feelings and answer their questions .
After he finished asking , one of the two policemen told the other , This is a mispointing incident .
It &apos;s not North Korean . &quot;
And they released me . It was a miracle .
Some North Koreans in China went to foreign embassies to seek asylum , but a lot of them were arrested by Chinese police and returned home .
these girls were very lucky .
because despite being arrested , learning was finally released thanks to pressure from the international community .
But these North Koreans are not so lucky .
Every year , there are countless North Koreans arrested in China and returned to the country where they were tortured , imprisoned , or publicly executed .
While I was very lucky that I was released , so many of my fellow citizens weren &apos;t .
The fact that North Koreans had to hide their identities and struggle to survive was a tragedy .
Even if they &apos;ve learned Chinese and found a job , then their lives can be utterly turned in just a moment .
That &apos;s why after 10 years of hiding my real identity I decided to risk going to South Korea , to start a new life again .
It &apos;s much more difficult to settle down to life here than I imagined .
Since in South Korea , English is incredibly important , I started learning English , my third language .
I also realized a huge gap between the South and North Koreans .
We were all North Koreans , but became very different as a result of 67 years of separation .
I went through a crisis about my origins .
Am I South Korean or North Korean?
Where do I come from ? and who am I ?
Suddenly , I didn &apos;t have a country to be proud to call the Nation .
Although to adapt to life in South Korea was not easy at all But I made a plan .
and start learning to prepare for the university exam .
However , just as I was just getting used to life here , I was told terrible news .
North Korean authorities discovered the money that I sent back to my family , and , as punishment , they would make my family move back to a rural quarantine zone .
So they could quickly get out of there , I started planning to help my family escape .
North Koreans have had to cross seemingly unthinkable distances to reach freedom .
Blessed because it was almost impossible to cross from North to South Korea , so , I had to fly to China and then back again to the North Korean border .
Because my family didn &apos;t know Chinese , I had to go with people across 2,000 miles in China and then on into Southeast Asia .
The bus journey lasted about 1 week , and it &apos;s been several times we &apos;ve almost been caught .
Once , our car was stopped and searched by a Chinese policeman .
He collected everyone &apos;s identity cards , and began to inquire .
Because my family did not understand Chinese , I thought they were going to be arrested .
When the Chinese policeman approached them , I immediately stood up and told him these were the deaf and mute people I was having to go with .
He looked at me with suspicion , but fortunately he believed my words .
And we kept going all the way up to the Lao border , velvet I had to use almost all the money I had to bribe the Lao border guards .
However , after we made it to the border , my family was arrested again in prison for illegal border crossing .
After I paid the fine and paid a bribe , my family was released for a month , and then arrested again in the capital of Laos .
It was the most desperate time of my life .
I did everything I could to get my family to freedom , and bravely I almost succeeded but they were arrested again while we were only a very short distance from the Korean embassy anymore .
I went back and forth between the immigration room and the police station , desperate to find a way to get my family out of there , but I no longer had enough money to bribe or pay the fine .
I was completely desperate .
Right at that moment , there was a man who asked me , &quot; What &apos;s up ? &quot;
I was incredibly surprised that a complete stranger would care so much to ask me like that .
In my little English capital and a dictionary , I told him the plight of my family . Without a little hesitation , that man went to the ATM . paid all the missing money to both my family and two other North Koreans so that they would be released from prison .
I thanked him with my whole heart , and I also asked , &quot; Why did you help me ? &quot;
&quot; I am not helping her , &quot; he answered .
&quot; &apos; I am helping North Koreans . &quot;
I realized that it was an incredibly significant moment in my life .
Goodness from the strange man became a new symbol of hope for me and also the North Korean people when we were desperately in need of it , and he showed me that goodness from strangers and the support of the international community were the very rays of hope we North Koreans were looking for .
Finally , after a long journey , my family and I were reunited in South Korea , but coming to freedom was only half of the struggle .
A lot of North Koreans are being separated from their families , and when they get to another country , they have to start from scratch with little or almost no money .
So we can get help from the international community for education , English training , vocational teaching , and many other areas .
We can also act as a bridge between people who are in North Korea and the outside world , because there are so many of us who are keeping in touch with other family members who are inside the country , and we share with them information and money to be able to change North Korea from the inside .
I &apos;ve been incredibly lucky to get so much help and to be inspired all my life , so I want me to be able to share the same strength to give my country an opportunity to thrive with international support .
I trust that you guys will see more and more successful North Koreans everywhere in the world , including on the TED stage .
Thank you .
I only have one request today .
Please don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Now I want to introduce you to my brothers
Remi was 22 years old , tall and very handsome ,
I can &apos;t speak , but I convey joy in a way that even some of the best rhetoric can &apos;t .
Remi knows what love is .
I share it unconditionally no matter what .
He wasn &apos;t greedy . I didn &apos;t discriminate in color of skin .
I don &apos;t care about religious differences , and understand that : He never lied .
When I sing songs from our childhood , trying to remember words that couldn &apos;t come to me either , he reminds me of one thing : we know little about how brains come , and how amazing the one that doesn &apos;t yet know has to be .
Samuel was 16 years old . I was tall . I was very handsome too .
I have an extremely perfect memory .
But also selective .
I don &apos;t remember if I swiped my chocolate candy bar , but I remember again the five releases of every single song on my iPod , the talks between us from when I was four , urinating on my hands on the day Teletubbies went on the first episode , and Lady Gaga &apos;s birthday .
These things sound amazing don't they?
But most people disagree .
And the fact is that because my kids &apos; minds don &apos;t match the normal version of society , they &apos;re often overlooked and misunderstood .
But what made my heart lighter and my soul stronger was that , even though this was true , even though you weren &apos;t seen as normal , this could only mean that : you were extraordinary -- narcissistic and extraordinary .
With you guys not very used to the phrase &apos; self-doubt &apos; , it &apos;s a brain complex disorder that affects the ability to socialize , learn and sometimes physical skills .
Disease symptom in each individual is different , which is why Remi is so different Sam .
And worldwide , one more person is diagnosed with autism every 20 minutes , and even though it &apos;s one of the fastest-growing disorders in the world , we don &apos;t know the cause or the cure .
And I can &apos;t remember the first time I approached autism , but I can &apos;t remember a day without it .
I was three years old when my little sister was born , and I was incredibly excited that there was one more person in my life .
And after a few months , I realized that you were different .
I screamed a lot .
I don &apos;t want to play like other babies , and in fact , I seem to enjoy nothing at all to me or anything else .
Remi lives and reigns in his own world , with his own rules , and I see joy in the smallest things , like putting cars around a room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything at hand .
As I grow up , I become even more different , and the difference becomes clearer .
But beyond outrage and resentment and overactiveness not resting is something really unique : a pure and naive instinct , a boy who sees life without prejudice , a human being who never lies .
Extraordinary .
Well , I can &apos;t deny that there &apos;s been a few difficult moments in my family , moments I wished the pond of kids was just like me .
But I took my memory back to the things that they taught me about personality and communication and love and I realized that these were things that I would not trade for normality .
Normality misses the beauty that difference gives us, and that we are different does not mean that one of us has something wrong
It just means there &apos;s another kind of &apos; right &apos; thing .
And if I can only convey one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you guys , which is that you &apos;re not required to be normal .
You can be extraordinary .
Because of whether or not autism is present , the difference between us -- We have a gift ! Everyone has a gift in us , and to be honest , pursuing the normal is the greatest potential sacrifice .
The opportunity for greatness , for progress and for change is snuffed out when we try to be like someone else .
Please -- don &apos;t say I &apos;m normal .
Thank you .
Perhaps you all agree with me this is a very beautiful road .
It &apos;s built out of asphalt , and asphalt is the kind of vehicle material that runs on it , it &apos;s very quiet . but it doesn &apos;t always do , especially not on these days like today when it &apos;s raining a lot .
Then you can get splashed by water on the road .
And especially if like you cycle , and get past these cars , it &apos;s not good .
Also , asphalt makes a lot of noise .
It &apos;s the noise material , If we make roads like the Dutch , very close to municipalities , we want a quiet road .
The solution to the problem is to make roads out of porous asphalt .
Styrofoam is the material we &apos;re now using to build most of the Dutch roads , It has a perimeter , and the water just seeps through the hole . so all the rainwater will come out on all sides , and you &apos;ll have a convenient road to drive . So no more water concave .
and the noise disappears through the water hole as well .
Because it was so empty , all the noise would go away , so the road was very quiet .
Naturally there &apos;s still much inconvenience , and what &apos;s inconvenience about this type of road is cracks , possible bubbles .
What &apos;s a crack ? You see that on this road kicking the peeling face .
First you get a stone , and then more and more , and more and more , and more and more , and then they -- -- oh my gosh , I won &apos;t do that .
But they can damage your car glasses . So you &apos;re not happy with that .
And then , this bubble will cause more and more damage .
Sometimes they make up chicken nests .
Oh . He is ready .
Chicken nests , naturally , can become a problem , But we have a solution .
Really as you see here , does this material show signs of being damaged ?
It &apos;s porous plastic , like I said , you only have a small amount of sticky stick between the stones .
Under the influence of weather , solar radiation , this condition of plastic chemical oxygen , this bitumen , this sticky substance between these conglomerates , contracts , and if it contracts , it has extremely small cracks , and then slopes out of the conglomerates .
Then if you drive up to that road , you destroy these collection blocks -- as we just saw here .
To solve this problem , we built self-heating materials .
If we make this self-healing material , then we can find a solution .
What we could do was , we used a steel bubble that &apos;s meant to wash the tub . And we cut the steel bubble out , which is really small , and we mixed these little bits with bitumen resin .
So we have asphalt mixed with very small scraps of steel .
Then you need a machine , which , as you see here , is a machine for cooking -- a magnetic sensor .
Magnetic reactions can create heat , steel in particular conducts it very well .
The things you do is heat the steel , you melt the bitumen , and the bitumen will flow into these microscopic cracks , and the stones will stick to the surface again .
I use a microwave oven today because I can &apos;t take the sensor from the cramped onto the stage .
The microwave oven has a similar working system .
I left the specimen in the oven , now I &apos;m going to take it out . To check it out .
This is the sample taken out .
I said we invent an industrial machine like the one above at the lab . to heat samples .
At the lab we tried through many samples , and then the government , they actually saw the results . and they thought , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s very nice way . We have to try and see what . &quot;
Then they handed us a section of the national road , 400 meters long under national road A58 , where we had to build a section of this new material testing road .
So that &apos;s what we did here . You look at the experimental path we did , and then naturally this path will survive for years with no damage . That &apos;s what we learn from experimentation .
We took many specimens from this path , and we tried them in the lab .
So we age the specimen , put more load on it , bind them up with a magnetic sensor , weld them up , and then try them again .
We can do it over and over again many times like that .
And actually , the conclusion coming out of this study is that if we had maintained the road every four years with a welding machine -- this is the large-sized version we built it to maintain real sugar -- If we had maintained the road once every four years we would have doubled the lifespan of the road &apos;s surface layer , which would of course save a lot of money .
Well , to recast , I can say we created a material that used steel fiber , added steel fiber , used magnetic heat , to actually help increase the life of road surfaces , Double the life of road surfaces is something that even you can do , Double the life of road surfaces with very simple tricks that will help save a lot of money .
Now surely you guys are wondering if it will work .
We have the model here . It &apos;s still pretty warm .
It should have been to let it cool down first , and then I showed you the effectiveness of healing therapy ,
But let me try and see .
See . Yeah , it sticks .
Thank you
I came here today to talk about a confused question whose answer is equally confusing .
The subject is the secret of domestic violence , and the question I ask is one that people have always wondered about : Why did she stay ?
Why should the woman stay with the person who beat them?
I am not a psychiatrist , not a social worker or an expert in domestic violence .
I was just a woman who wanted to share her story
I was 22 years old then , just graduated from Harvard College .
I moved to New York City when I did my first job writing and editing for Seventeen magazine .
I first had my own apartment , American Express credit card , and I had the big secret .
That secret was , this gun loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed directly at my head by the man I had thought was my partner , over and over .
The man I loved more than everyone pointed a gun to my head and threatened to kill me know how many times I can no longer remember .
I came here to tell you about mad love , a disguised psychological trap under the cover of love that millions of women and even some men steal every year .
This could be your story .
I am not the same model as a domestic violence counselor .
I have a bachelor &apos;s degree in English from Harvard College , and Marketing Business Administration from Wharton Business School .
I &apos;ve come to the end of my career working for companies in the top 500s of America like Johnson &amp; amp ; Johnson , Leo Burnett and the Washington Times .
I married a second husband for almost 20 years and had three children together .
My dog is a Black Lab , and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan .
So the first thing I want to tell you is that domestic violence happens to everyone , every gender , every religion , every level of income and education .
It happens everywhere .
And the second thing I want to say is that people think that domestic violence happens to women , it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue .
Not right .
More than 85 percent of abusers are men , and domestic violence occurs only in close , binding , long-term relationships , in other words , in the family , where ultimately we desire or look forward to finding that violence is one reason domestic violence is a confusing issue .
I told myself , I am the rest of the earth to live with the man who beat me , but actually , I am a typical victim due to my age .
I &apos;m only 22 years old , living in the United States , women ages 16 to 24 are three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls at this age are killed every year by abusive partners , boyfriends , and husbands in the United States .
I &apos;ve also been a typical victim because I know nothing about domestic violence , its warning signals or role models .
I met Conor for a month night , rain and cold .
He sat next to me in the New York City tunnel , and he made a conversation with me .
He told me about two things .
One was that he , as with me , had just graduated from Ivy League school , and that he worked at a very impressive bank in Wall Street .
But what resonates the most with me at the first encounter is that he &apos;s smart , he &apos;s playful , and he looks like a farmer boy .
He had mounds that were this big , big apple-shaped cheekbones and hair that looked like a golden field of rice , and he seemed so sweet .
One of the smartest things Conor did , from the beginning , was to create a hallucination that I was a promising relationship partner .
He made this distinction at first by worshipping me .
We started dating , and he loved me in every way that I was smart , that I chose Harvard , that I was passionate about helping new girls and work .
He wanted to know everything about my family and about my childhood , the hopes and dreams that plagued me .
Conor trusted me , as a writer and a woman in a way no one had ever .
And he also created the magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing to his secrets , that , he was like a child from the age of four who had been cruelly and continuously physically abused by his stepfather , and the abuse worsened to make him leave school at eight , even though he was very intelligent , and it took him almost 20 years to rebuild his life .
That explains why his degree at Ivy Leage and his job at Wall Street and his bright future meant so much to him .
If you told me that this smart , fun , sensitive man , my dear who gives me a day off to the throne when do I get makeup or not , how short my dress is , where I live , what work I do , who my friend is and where I spend Christmas , I would laugh at you because there &apos;s no trace of violence or control or anger in Conor from the beginning .
I didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to tempt and seduce the victim .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second stage was victim isolation .
Now , Conor didn &apos;t return home one day and announced that &quot; Hey , you know , all this Romeo and juliet-style fingernail is great , but I need to move to the next stage where I isolate and torment you &quot; — — &quot; so I need to take you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear her screaming and out of this city where she has friends and family and colleagues can see the bruises . &quot;
Instead , Conor went home on a Friday night and he told me he quit his job today his dream job , and he said , he quit because of me , because I did you feel safe and loved that he didn &apos;t need to prove himself in Wall Street for half more and that he just wanted to go from this city away from his unusual and abusive family , away to a little town in New England where he could start his life again with me .
Now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York and my dream job , but I thought you had to sacrifice your partner , so , I agreed and quit , Conor and I left Manhattan together .
I hadn &apos;t thought at all that I had plunged into a crazy love , that I was taking the first steps into a carefully arranged psychological , financial and physical trap .
The next step in this violent scenario is to bring in the threat of violence and see how she reacts .
From here , gunfire came in .
when we moved to New England -- you know , the place Conor relied on to feel safe -- he bought three guns .
He kept a tree in the storage compartment of our car .
A tree under our pillow, our bed place, the third one he's always between in his wallet.
And he said he needed these guns because of the trauma he had experienced in the past as a child .
He needs them to feel protected .
But these guns were really a message to me , and although he hadn &apos;t brought his arm toward me , my life was in danger every minute of every day .
Conor attacked me five days before our wedding .
It was at 7 a.m. when I was still in my pajamas .
I was lamg working on the rooftop , trying to be wild into the written assigned article and I was discouraged , Conor used my anger as defense to take my arms around my neck and squeeze them so tightly that I couldn &apos;t breathe or scream , and he struck my head against the wall with his index finger repeatedly .
Five days later , ten bruises on my neck were visible , and I wore my mother &apos;s wedding dress , and married him .
Despite the things that have happened , I &apos;m still sure we &apos;ll live happily ever after because I love him and he loves me so much , too .
and he regretted it deeply .
He was really very stressed out because of the wedding and the starting of my family with me .
It was isolated incident tissue , and he would never hurt me again .
It happened two more times during the honeymoon .
For the first time , I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost , he hit me on one side of my head so hard that my head kept banging on the glass of the car .
A few days later , while driving home from his honeymoon , he got tired of the car , and he threw a whole bag of Big Mac food in my face .
Conor went on to beat me once to twice every week for the next two months and half a year from getting married .
I was wrong to think that I was the only case and that I was alone in this .
One in three American women experience domestic violence or stalking in some stage of their lives , and the CDC report shows 15 million children experience abuse every year , 15 million .
So I was actually in the company very well
Back to my question : Why am I staying ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was abusing me .
Even he pointed a gun to my head , pushed me to the floor , threatened to kill my dogs , pulled the keys out of my car as I was driving into the highway pouring grinds cafe over my head as I was dressed for the interview , I never once thought of myself as an abused wife .
Instead , I was a strong woman in love with a problem man , and I was the only one on earth who could help Conor face his evil .
The other question that people often ask is , why didn &apos;t she leave ?
why didn &apos;t I walk away ? I could have walked away at any time .
With me , it &apos;s the saddest and most painful question , because we , the victims , know some things that you don &apos;t usually know : what a horrible danger to leave an abuser like that .
Because the last step in the domestic abuse scenario is to kill her .
More than 70 percent of domestic abuse crimes occur after the victim ends a relationship , after she leaves , because then that abuser has nothing to lose .
But other consequences such as long-term surveillance , even after the abuser marries again ; deprivation of financial resources ; and advocacy by the family full sentence system to terrify the victim and her children , who are often coerced by court rulings to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother .
And do we keep asking , why didn &apos;t she walk away ?
I was able to walk away , because a rough blow finally smashed my resignation .
I realized that the man I so loved would kill me if I abandoned him .
So I break the silence .
I tell everyone : the wingman , my neighbors , my friends and family , who are completely strangers , and I stand here today because you are all helping me .
We have stereotypical notions of victims as scary headlines , women who ruin themselves , hurt good things .
The question , &quot; Why did she stay ? &quot;
is the reason of some people , &quot; It was her fault to stay &quot; as if the victim had chosen to love men with the intention of destroying us .
But from the publication of &quot; Crazy Love &quot; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of stories from men and women who have also walked away , who learnt an invaluable life lesson from but what happened , and who rebuild lives -- happy , cheerful-- as employees , as wives , as mothers , living lives of complete non-violence , like me .
Because of the fact that I am a typical victim of ended domestic violence I am a typical survivor of domestic violence .
I married a decent and kind man again , and we had three children together .
I have the Black Lab dog and I have the Minivan .
What I never had half again , forever , was a gun pointed at my head by someone who said he loved me .
Right at this moment , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; Oh , this is amazing &quot; or , &quot; Oh , how stupid is she ? &quot; but all this time , I &apos;ve been really talking about you .
I am sure that you among those who are hearing me speak at the moment are people who are being mistreated or who have been mistreated as children or who abuse themselves
mistreatment can affect your daughter , your sister , your best friend at the moment .
I can end my crazy love story by breaking the silence .
I am smashing the silence today .
This is how I help other victims , and this is my last request .
Tell about what you get to hear here .
The mistreatment is only frightening in silence .
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by pointing a light at it .
We victims need everyone .
We need you to understand the secret of domestic violence .
Take a whistle at the mistreatment of the light of today by talking about it with your children , your colleagues , your friends and your family .
Rewrite their lives as but happy , lovely people with open futures .
Recognize the early signals of violence and the lies of conscience , reduce it , give victims a safe exit .
Together we can make our beds, tables and our families peaceful and safe oasis
Thanks
I want to talk to you about a very special group of animals
There are now about 10,000 bird species in the world .
vultures are one of the most seriously threatened groups of birds
When you see a vulture like this , the first thing that comes into your head is , these are disgusting creatures , ugly , greedy , and only aimed at your flesh , associating themselves with politicians .
I want to change that perception . I want to change the feelings that you give to these birds , because they need our sympathy . They really need it .
I will tell you why .
First , why do they have such bad impressions ?
When Charles Darwin crossed the Pacific in 1832 from the Beagle , he saw Turkish vultures , He said , &quot; These birds are disgusting with red-breasted heads made to cheer in stench .
You can &apos;t get worse humiliated than that , and those are the words from Charles Darwin .
You know , He changed his opinion when he came back , To tell you why .
They &apos;ve also been associated with Disney-- personalized as dumb , ridiculous , stupid characters .
More recently , if you &apos;re following the news in Kenya these are the characteristic attributes that bond with Keya military scenes . But I want to resist that .
I want to resist because you know?
because military police don &apos;t keep the environment clean .
Military police didn &apos;t help prevent the spread of disease .
They can barely regime one-wife .
They were far from extinct .
And , what I like the most is , the vultures look much better .
There are two kinds of vultures on this planet .
The Xinjiang vultures that were found were mainly in America , like the condor and caracaras that followed , the Old World vultures , where there were about 16 species . Of these 16 , 11 faced a high risk of extinction .
So , why are vultures important ? First of all , they provide essential ecological services . They clean up .
They &apos;re really natural dumpsters .
They clear dead bodies to the bone .
They help kill bacteria . They help absorb coal disease that was already able to spread and cause tremendous losses to the cattle industry and disease to other animals .
The nearest studies have shown that in areas without vultures , dead bodies need three to four times as long to break down , and the tremendous consequence from this is the spread of disease .
vultures also have an epic history of their importance .
They have been linked to ancient Egyptian culture
Nekhbets are symbols of protection and motherhood , and together with the bear snake , they symbolize the merger of the Debauchery &amp; amp ; Debauchery of Egypt .
In Hindu mythology , Jatayu is the vulture god , He risked his life to save the goddess Sita from the hands of the devil 10 heads of R .
In Tibetan culture , they perform a very important burial . In places like Tibet , there &apos;s no place to bury the dead , or no wood to burn them , so the vultures provide a natural waste disposal system .
So what's the vulture being up to?
We have eight vultures that appear in Kenya , of which six are threatened with high risk of extinction .
The reason is that they &apos;re being poisoned , they &apos;re being poisoned because there &apos;s human-and wild world scrambles . Pastoral communities are using this poison to target predatory animals but instead , the vultures are victimized for this .
In South Asia , countries like India and Pakistan , four vulture species are enlisted on the list of those at extreme risk which means that they have only 10 or 15 years left to reach extinction , and the reason that is because they are preyed on for eating cattle that have been cured with painkillers like Diclofenac .
The drug has been banned from use in the veterinary industry in India They have demonstrated that
Since there &apos;s no vulture , there &apos;s just a rampant proliferation of wild dogs in areas where animal carcasses are stored When you have wild dogs , you have a huge time bomb on rabies . The number of rabies has gone up a lot in India .
Kenya will have the largest wind fans field in Africa with 353 engines to be fitted at Lake Turkana
I don &apos;t oppose wind energy , but we need to cooperate with the government , because wind engines make the birds this . They cut in two .
They are grinders of birds .
In West Africa there &apos;s a dead vulture trade that &apos;s horrible to serve the magic and cloth market .
So what did we do ? We were conducting research on these birds . We were attaching signal transmitters to them .
We &apos;re trying to identify their basic ecology , and follow the mark where they come from .
We can see them moving to a lot of different countries , so if you focus only on problems on a regional scale , this won &apos;t help you at all .
We need to cooperate with the government on a regional level .
We are collaborating with local communities
We are telling them about the importance of the vultures the intrinsic necessity for cherishing these wonderful creatures and the benefits they bring .
How do you help ? you can become an active person , create a voice . You can write to your government and tell them that we need to pay attention to these misunderstood creatures . Volunteer a little bit less time transmitting messages . spreading messages .
When you walk out of this room , you get information about vultures , but tell your family , children , neighbors about vultures .
They were very graceful . Charles Darwin said He changed his opinion because he had seen them flying as relaxed as without the slightest amount of force in the sky .
Kenya , this world , would be a lot poorer without these amazing animals .
Thank you very much .
When I was 11 , I remember one morning I woke up hearing the glee in my house .
My dad was listening to BBC news at the time on his little gray radio
He smiled a very big smile , which was very unusual because news often made him sad .
He shouted : &quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot;
I didn &apos;t understand it well at the time but I can see that my dad was very , very excited .
&quot; Now you can actually go to school already , &quot; he said .
One morning that I can &apos;t forget .
A real school .
You know , the Taliban have come to encroach on Afghanistan since I was 6 years old and ban girls from school .
For five years after that , I dressed as 1 son to go with my sister to a secret school because my sister was forbidden from leaving her house describing herself .
It was the only way that we could go to school .
Every day , we take different paths so that no one doubts our destination .
We hide books and notebooks in market baskets like that people would think we just go shopping .
That school in a house , over 100 of us crowded into a small , narrow living room .
It &apos;s pretty warm in winter but it &apos;s extremely hot in summer .
We all know are risking our own lives teachers , students and our parents .
On several occasions , the school suddenly closed for about a week because of suspected Taliban .
We were always wondering what they knew about us .
Are we being tracked?
Do they know where we are?
We were scared , but even so , we still wanted to go to school .
I was very lucky to be raised in a family where learning was very cherished and girls were valued .
My grandfather was a person who was repugnant in that time
One who was completely abandoned from a distant province in Afghanistan , he begged for his daughter , my mother to go to school , and so he was abandoned by his father .
But my educated mother became a teacher .
Here she is .
She retired 2 years ago to use our house to open schools for girls and women in neighbors .
And this is my dad he was the first in his family to be educated .
There &apos;s no doubt that his children will be educated , including his daughter , despite the Taliban , and despite the dangers .
For him , uneducated children were a greater danger than ever .
During the Taliban years , I remember that there were times when I was very angry about our lives and was always scared and didn &apos;t see the future .
I would love to give up learning , but my dad , he would say , &quot; Listen , daughter , you can lose everything you have in this life .
Your money could be robbed . You could be forced to leave your home during wartime .
But one thing that will forever exist with you is the one in here , and if we &apos;re forced to sell blood to pay for obesity schooling , we do .
Then do you want to go on any more?
I was 22 today .
I was raised in a country that had been destroyed by decades of war .
Less than 6 percent of the women of my age were in high school , and if my family had not committed to my education , I would have become one of them as well .
But but , I stand here proudly as a Middlebury High School graduate .
When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , who was abandoned by his family because he dared to send his daughter to school , was one of the first to congratulate me .
He didn &apos;t show off about my college degree , but about me being the first woman , and I was the first woman to be able to drive him on Kabul roads .
My family trusts me .
I dream big , but my family wishes for me even bigger .
So I am the global ambassador to 10x10 , which is the global campaign to educate women .
So I helped establish SOLA , the first and must have been the only school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it was still dangerous for girls to go to school .
I was excited to see students coming to my school with the expectation to take this opportunity .
And I find their parents and their dads like my father , supporting them , despite and even when facing many difficult oppositions .
As Ahmed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I can &apos;t show his face , but Ahmed is the father of a student of mine .
Less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way to SOLA from their village , and they were actually just knocked out of death by a roadside bomb in just a few minutes .
When he had just come home , the phone , a voice threatened him if he continued to take his daughter to school , they would try again .
He replied , &quot; If you want to kill me , then kill me , but I will not ruin the future of my daughter because of the people &apos;s backward and dystopian ideas . &quot;
I &apos;ve now noticed about Afghanistan , and this is something that &apos;s often overlooked in the West , is that behind almost every successful person we &apos;re a father who cherishes the value of their daughter and who sees his daughter &apos;s success as his or her own success .
This is not saying the mother is not important in our success .
Indeed , they were the first and the merchant to persuade a bright future for their daughters , but in social circumstances like Afghanistan , we need the support of the men .
Under the Taliban , girls who went to school in hundreds remembered that , it was illegal .
But today , more than 3 million girls are studying in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks very different when seen from America .
I find that Americans see weakness , fragility in changes .
I fear that all those changes will not last longer after the withdrawal of the American military .
But when I returned to Afghanistan , when I saw students in my school and their parents supporting them , encouraging them , I saw a promising future and change that would last .
For me , Afghanistan is a country of hope , of unlimited possibilities , and every day SOLA school girls remind me of that .
As I do , they have big dreams .
Thanks .
Hello . This is my cell phone .
A cell phone can change your life , and a phone also gives you personal freedom .
With a cell phone , you can capture images of human rights abuses in Syria .
With a cell phone , you can also post a message on Tweeter and start participating in a protest against the government in Egypt .
And also with a phone you can record a song , post it up and become famous .
All of that can totally just with your cell phone .
I was a kid of 1984 , and I lived in the city of Berlin .
Let &apos;s go back to that moment , in this city .
You can see here the way that thousands of people stand up and protest for change .
That &apos;s in the fall of 1989 , and imagine people who stood up and protested for that change having a cell phone in their pocket .
Who in the auditorium has a cell phone ?
Hold it up .
Hold your phone up , hold your phone up high !
Hold it up high . An Android phone , Blackberry , wow .
A lot . Today , the majority of us have a cell phone .
But today I &apos;m going to talk about myself and my phone , and about how it changed my life .
I will talk about that .
There &apos;s about 35830 information arrays .
Purely elementary information .
But why are those information here ?
Cause of the summer of 2006 , the European Commission proposed a formal directive .
It &apos;s called the Data Conservation Directive .
This directive says each telecommunications company in Europe , each Internet service provider across the European territory , must store vast amounts of information about users .
Who was the one calling who ? Who sent someone an email ?
Who sent who the mobile messages ?
And if you use mobile phones , then this is exactly where the problem exists .
All of this information is stored for at least six months , up to two years , by the network you &apos;re using or the Internet service provider .
And all over Europe , people stood up and said , &quot; We don &apos;t want to be . &quot;
They said , we don &apos;t want this storage of personal information .
We want to have autonomy in the digital age , and we don &apos;t want that telecommunications companies and Internet service providers store all of our information back .
They were lawyers , journalists and even parish fathers , all saying , &quot; We don &apos;t want to be . &quot;
And you can see here , like 10,000 people joining a parade in the streets of Berlin and chanting the slogan &quot; Freedom , not fear &quot;
And a few people even said , it &apos;s like Stasi 2.0 .
Stasi are secret police forces operating in East Germany .
I &apos;ve also been wondering , actually does it work ?
Will they be able to save our entire information ?
Every time we use our cell phones ?
I therefore asked my network to use , Deutsche Telekom , Germany &apos;s largest telecommunications provider at the time , and I asked them , please , to send me the whole of my information that they stored .
I asked them to send me just once , and I went on asking , but what I got was just an unclear answer . Blah blah blah .
But then I said , I want to get these information , because they are storing my life .
And I decided I was going to file a lawsuit with the court , because I probably wanted to get these information .
But Deutsche Telekom said , no , we won &apos;t give you these information .
And finally , I had a deal with them .
I would drop the lawsuit , and they would give me the information I requested .
Because at that point , the federal constitutional court established that this European Commission directive had no effect in Germany &apos;s constitutional system .
I therefore got this ugly brown envelope with a CD inside .
And on the CD , the one I needed was recorded on it .
35830 array of information .
First I looked at it , and said , okay . It &apos;s a big data file . Good .
But then I realized , this is my whole life .
This is life in my six months , which has been recorded in whole in this data file .
Then I got a little bit wondering , what should I do with it here ?
Because I can see the places I went there , where I sleep every night , the things I did .
But then I said , I want to make these information public .
I want it to be known to the public .
Because I want to show people what data conservation really is .
So for Zeit Online and Open Data City , I did the same thing .
These are visual images of life for six months that have been recorded of me .
You can zoom in or zoom in on it , you can also spin backwards or faster forwards .
You can see every step of me .
You can even know how I got to Frankfurt by train to Cologne , and also how often I made contact between those two locations .
All possible with these information .
I had a little fear .
But those information wasn &apos;t just about me .
It is information about all of us .
First , it &apos;s just like this , I call my wife and she calls me too , we talk to each other a couple of three times .
And then a couple of friends called me , they called each other again .
Moments later you call you , and you call you , and you get this vast network of communication .
But you can see the way in which we communicate with each other , when they call each other , when they go to sleep .
You can see all that .
You can see the most important parts , like the leaders in a group .
If you get access to these information , you can see the activity of both the community , the society .
If you had access to these information , you could control entire societies .
This is a design drawing for countries like China or Iran .
This is a drawing of how to survey society as a whole because you probably know which people talk to which people , which people sent out emails , that &apos;s all possible if you have access to these information .
And these information are stored for at least six months in Europe , for as long as two years .
As I said at the beginning , imagine if all these people on the streets of Berlin in the fall of 1989 had a cell phone in their pocket .
Then maybe Stasi will know who participated in this protest , and if Stasi knows who the leader is behind it , then maybe it will never be possible .
The collapse of the Berlin wall is likely not going to survive .
And if so , then perhaps the collapse of the Iron Mantle in the Cold War would not exist either .
Because today , authorities and companies want to preserve the information they get about us as much as possible , both online and offline .
They want to have the ability to follow our lives closely , and for that reason they want to retain these information at every moment .
Autonomy and living in a digital age are in no contradiction .
What you should do is fight for your autonomy today .
And you have to fight relentlessly for it every day .
Then , when you go back home , tell your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value , and that &apos;s not outdated .
When you return home , tell only your representative that by companies and authorities it &apos;s possible to retain specific information , even though they don &apos;t necessarily have to .
And if you don &apos;t trust me , ask the network for the information that they &apos;ve stored about themselves .
So in the future , every time you use your phone let it remind you that you have to fight for personal autonomy in this digital age .
Thanks .
Photography has been my passion since I was old enough to hold a camera , but today I want to share with you 15 pictures that I cherish most , and I took none of them myself .
There &apos;s no art director , no stylist , no capture , not even an interest in light .
In fact , most of them were taken by visitors who happened to pass by .
The story begins when I went to New York City to participate in a speech , and my wife took a picture of me hugging my daughter on her first birthday . We stood on the corner of 57th and 5th .
We happened to go back to New York exactly a year later , so we decided to take one more picture like that .
You can see where the story is leading .
When it was coming up to my daughter &apos;s 3rd birthday , my wife said , &quot; Why don &apos;t you take Sabrina to New York for a father-and-daughter-on tour , and then go on to the old &quot; ritual &quot; ?
From there we started getting tourists by the way to take pictures
You know , the move to give your camera to a complete stranger is remarkably popular worldwide .
No one refused , and fortunately no one has run away with our cameras yet .
Back then , we had no idea how that trip would change our lives .
It became so sacred to us .
This was taken a few weeks after events 11 / 9 , and I tried to explain what happened that day in ways that a 5-year-old could understand .
These pictures are more than a representation of a moment , or some special trip .
They are a way for us to stop time for a week of October , to think about our time and how we change with each year , not just physically , but in every way .
Because even though we take the same picture , our perspective changes , my daughter reaches new milestones , and I get to see her life through her eyes , how she watches and interacts with things .
This time that we focus on each other is something we cherish and expect all year long .
Recently , on one trip , we were walking when my daughter stopped suddenly in the middle of the road , and she just went to the red eaves of the doll shop that she enjoyed as a child on our previous trips .
The baby described to me how it felt when she was five years old , when she stood in that right position .
It said it remembered his heart beating out of his chest when he first saw that store nine years ago .
And now the things it saw in New York were universities , because it had decided to go to school in New York .
And I realized : one of the most important things that we create is memory .
So I want to share the idea of taking a proactive role in creating memories .
I don &apos;t know how you guys are , but apart from these 15 pictures , I don &apos;t appear very much in family photos .
I was always the photographer .
So today I want to encourage everyone to be in the picture , and don &apos;t hesitate to step up to someone , and ask , &quot; You take pictures help us ? &quot;
Thanks .
I have never forgotten my grandmother &apos;s words proving -- she died in martyrdom : &quot; Hey , grandchild , fight against Gaddafi . Fight against him .
But never turn into a Gaddafi-style form of revolutionary person . &quot;
Nearly two years have passed since the Libyan Conquest broke out , energized by widespread waves of encouragement from the Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings .
I participated in forces inside and outside Libya to call for the day of fury and to start a revolution against Gaddafi tyranny .
And it was a great revolution .
Young men and women headed the front lines for overthrowing the government , raising banners about freedom , dignity , social justice .
They have made clear an example of compassion in confronting Gaddafi &apos;s brutal dictatorship .
They showed a painted solidarity that spread east to west and extended all the way south .
Eventually , after six months of heavy war with total casualties of up to 50,000 people , we managed to free our country and overthrow the tyrant .
However , Gaddafi left a burden , a legacy of the institutional tyranny , corruption , and divisional infestations .
Throughout the four decades , Gaddafi &apos;s brutal tyranny destroyed the infrastructure and the culture and moral foundations of Libyan society .
Recognizing the destruction and challenges , I , as with many other women , openly rebuild Libya &apos;s civil society , calling for inclusivity and a transition to democracy and national reconciliation .
Nearly 200 organizations were set up in Benghazi throughout that time , and just after Gaddafi collapsed -- almost 300 in Tripoli .
After 33 years of being repatriated , I returned to Libya , with a unique passion , I started giving capacity-building , human development training classes in leadership skills .
The same wonderful group of women , I co-founded the Libyan Women for Peace a women &apos;s movement , leaders from all different segments of society , to lobby for the social political empowerment of women and to advocate for our right to equal participation in building democracy and peace .
I was in an extremely difficult pre-election period , an increasingly polarized environment , one shaped by selfish political views filled with domination and exclusion .
I led an initiative by the Libyan Women’s Forces for Peace to lobby for a more comprehensive electoral law , one that could give every citizen , regardless of their background , the right to be elected and to run for office , and most importantly , set aside a regulation for political parties that had to stitch together male and female candidates both vertically and horizontally on their lists creating a lock-shaped list .
Eventually our initiative was accepted and successful as well .
Women won 17.5 percent of the State Assembly in the first elections in the last 52 years or so .
But little by little , little by little , the excitement from the elections and of the revolution disappeared overall -- as day by day we woke up to news of violence .
One day we woke up to news of the blasphemy of ancient temples and Sufi tombs .
The other day we woke up to news of the massacre of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate .
Another day we woke up to news of the assassination of military officers .
And every day , every day we woke up to the militia &apos;s laws and their successive violations of human rights with prisoners and disrespect for the provisions in their laws .
Our society , shaped by revolutionary mindsets , became more polarized and moved away from the ideals , the principles of freedom , dignity , social equality that we pursued at first .
Intolerance , exclusion and vengeance became emblematic of the beginnings .
I didn &apos;t intend here to inspire you with the story of success in creating the tractor-shaped list and the elections .
Which I came here to confess that we -- the entire country made the wrong choice , made the wrong decision .
We have not prioritized citizenship .
Because elections don &apos;t bring peace , stability or security to Libya .
Will the lock-to-shoulder list and intersection of male and female candidates bring peace and reconciliation to the country?
No , not at all .
So in the end what did it help ?
Why does our society continue to be a polarized and dominated society by selfish politics of domination and exclusion , by both men and women ?
It &apos;s possible that the deficiencies are not just in terms of women &apos;s rights peacefulness , but women &apos;s values of compassion , tolerance , and inclusivity .
Our society needs a national dialogue and constructive empathy rather than elections that , only increase polarization and division .
Our society needs qualified representations from women rather than numbers and numbers of female representation .
We need to stop acting like hysterical messengers , stop supporting hysterical days .
We need to start acting like messengers of compassion and tolerance .
We need to develop a women &apos;s talk that &apos;s not just honoring , but that has to practice tolerance instead of hostility , collaboration instead of competition , inclusivity instead of exclusion .
These are the necessary ideas that a war-torn country like Libya absolutely needs to be able to reap peace .
Because peace as alchemy , it needs harmony , the intersection of male and female perspectives .
That &apos;s the real zipper .
And we need to establish that vital element before we do the political side -- the social side .
According to a verse from the Koran &quot; Salam &quot; -- peace -- &quot; is the word of God full of tolerance , raheem . &quot;
Next , the word &quot; raheem &quot; known in Abrahamian traditions shares a similar origin to Arabic for &quot; rahem &quot; -- uterus-- a expression for femaleness -- maternal love wraps itself around humanity where men and women , from every tribe , every people , are born .
And because the uterus completely encases the embryo that &apos;s growing in its lap , the sacred matrix of mercy feeds that whole life .
So we are taught that &quot; Our tolerance transcends everything &quot; .
So we are taught that &quot; Our tolerance wins outrage &quot; .
Bridge each of us to the grace of tolerance .
Applause Thanks
5 years ago , I went through 1 thing that was a little bit like Alice in the Apocalypse .
Penn State School asked me , a communication teacher to teach a communication course to engineering students .
I was so scared .
Really afraid . Afraid of big-headed students , big books and also strange words .
But when the exchanges opened up , I experienced what Alice must have also experienced when she fell into the rabbit cave and discovered the door that led to 1 new world .
That &apos;s just what I feel when I communicate with students . I am amazed by their ideas , and I want others to also experience this ancestral homeland .
I believe that the key to opening the door to that world is good communication .
We desperately need to communicate effectively with scientists and engineers to be able to change the world .
Scientists and engineers are the ones who are confronted with the biggest challenges , from energy to the environment and health , and there &apos;s much more , If we don &apos;t know and don &apos;t understand that , it &apos;s not going to be done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility , the unskilled , to interact with them .
But effective exchanges cannot take place if scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us into their homeland .
Scientists and engineers , let &apos;s have eight quirks with us .
I want to share a few secrets to doing so to be sure we find British science charming , technical sexy as well , hot .
The first question is : Why ?
Why science concerns us .
Don &apos;t just say you study bone tissue , but let &apos;s say you study bone tissue , it &apos;s like the nets that make our bone because it takes knowing to understand osteoporosis and the cure .
When describing science , be careful when using the term .
The term prevents us from understanding British ideas .
It is certainly possible to say &quot; spatial and temporal &quot; but why not use &quot; space and time &quot;
Making my ideas understandable isn &apos;t about downplaying them .
Instead , asxtanh said : make things as simple as possible , but don &apos;t get simpler .
Obviously he could talk about scientific problems without distorting ideas .
Mindful of giving examples , telling stories , relating It &apos;s ways to entice and delight us with the things he says .
And when presenting , don &apos;t use bullet points .
Ever wondered why to call them &quot; bullet points &quot; ?
When you underline names , what ? Underline is wiping out , killing always ! and they will kill his presentation as well .
A slide like this , not only boring , but also overly dependent on the language area of the brain , puts us in locks .
Instead , this example slide by Genevieve Brown is actually more productive . It shows that the special structure of bone tissue is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the Ép-phen tower .
And the tip here is to use simple and easy sentences , the audience can rely on them if they don &apos;t catch up in time , and then use visuals that appeal to the senses to help us deepen our understanding of the things that are presented .
I think these are just a few of the secrets that help us open that door and see the magical homeland of science and technology .
The engineers I work with teach me to know how to decay things . So I want to sum up with 1 equation .
Take &quot; science &quot; minus &quot; bullet points &quot; and &quot; term &quot; and then divide it for &quot; validation &quot; , that is , share validating explanations with the audience , then multiply with the &quot; passion &quot; that he devotes to the work he &apos;s doing , then the result will be Great Interaction that yields Comprehensive Understanding .
And therefore , scientists and engineers , when you guys solve this equation , at any rate , say eight quirks to me .
Thank you .
Hello . I &apos;m Cameron Russell , and for the last short time , I &apos;m a model .
Indeed , for 10 years .
And I felt an uncomfortable pressure in the room at the moment because I shouldn &apos;t have been wearing this ass .
Luckily I had another suit with me .
It &apos;s the first time that someone has replaced a person on the stage of TED so I think you &apos;re very lucky to see this scene .
If like a few women feel so scared when I show up , you don &apos;t have to say I hear right now , but then I &apos;ll know over Twitter .
I realize I &apos;m very lucky to be able to change what you think of me in 10 short seconds .
Not everyone has a chance to do this .
These high heels are not at all comfortable , I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
The worst part is shoving this long sleeve over my head because you guys laugh at me every time , so don &apos;t do anything when it &apos;s above my head .
Deck already .
Why would I ?
It was so grotesque .
Indeed , the hope is that it &apos;s not so grotesque as this picture .
The image has a huge power , but it &apos;s also very artificial .
I just completely changed what you think of me within 6 seconds .
And in this picture , actually I haven &apos;t had a boyfriend in real life .
I felt very uncomfortable at the time , and the photographer told me to complain and put my hand in his hair .
And of course , except for the surgery , or the artificial tan that I had two days ago to photograph , there &apos;s little that we can do to change our appearance , and our appearance , even though it &apos;s artificial and hard to change , it has a huge effect on our lives .
So today , to me , fearlessness means being honest .
And I stand on this stage because I am a model .
I stand on this stage because I am beautiful , a white woman , and in the modeling industry , we call it a charming girl .
And I would answer questions that people always asked me , but with honesty .
The first question was , how did I become a model ?
And I always said , &quot; Oh , I was discovered &quot; , but it made no sense at all .
Indeed I became the model because I won the genetic lottery , and I was the recipient of inheritance , and maybe you guys are wondering what inheritance is .
In the last decades , we have defined beauty not only as healthy and youthful and the balance we are biologically programmed to yearn for , but also as height , slender and feminine lines , and white .
This is the very one legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s one that I make money on .
I know that there are a few of you who are skeptical of this point , and there may be a few models who dress as well as being , &quot; Thanks . Naomi . Tyra . Joan Smalls . Liu Wen . &quot;
I want to praise your models &apos; understanding . Very impressive .
But unfortunately I have to tell you in 2007 , a doctoral student at New York University counted as all the models on the runway , and of those 677 models hired , only 27 , less than 4 percent , were not white .
The next question that people always ask me is : &quot; Can you be a model when you get older ? &quot;
And my first answer was : &quot; You don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not in charge of recruitment &quot; .
But the next answer I really want to say to those girls is : &quot; Why not ? &quot;
You know ? You can become anyone .
You could become President of America , or the inventor of the next Internet , or be a ninja cardiologist poet , would be great , wouldn &apos;t you , since I would be the first to do that &quot; .
If , after that one interesting list , you still say , &quot; No , no , Cameron , do you want to be a model ? &quot; , then I &apos;ll say , &quot; Get your boss away &quot; .
Since you have no power at all , you could be the editor-in-chief of Vogue in America or the Director-General of H &amp; amp ; M , or future Steven Meisel .
Saying that I want to be a model when I grow up is like saying I want to win a number ticket when I grow up .
It &apos;s out of my control , and it &apos;s great , but it &apos;s not a career path .
I &apos;m going to demonstrate to you guys -- with 10 years of experience I accumulated as a model , because it &apos;s not the same as a heart surgeon , so it only takes a short time .
If the photographer stands here and the light is there , it &apos;s like a nice interactive interface , and when the customer says , &quot; Cameron we want a picture of you walking &quot; , so this leg goes first , beautiful and long , this hand hits backwards , and this one comes forwards , the head comes forwards , the head is at three quarters , and you simply go up and down , just do it , and then you turn your head to look behind , imagine it &apos;s your friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
Like this here .
The hope is that it is less grotesque than the picture in between
I don &apos;t know what happens in that moment anymore .
Regrettably after you finish school , you write a résumé and once did a few things , you can &apos;t say any more , because if you say you want to be President of the United States but your résumé says , &quot; Underwear Model : 10 years &quot; , people will look at you with different eyes .
The next question that people always ask me : &quot; Are all the pictures correctly edited ? &quot;
All right , almost all the photos are edited out , but that &apos;s just a small element of the things going on .
This was one of the first pictures that I ever took , which was also the first time that I took pictures of bathing suits , and I didn &apos;t even have a menstrual cycle at the time .
I know that we &apos;re going deep into personality but I was a little girl then .
This is my look , taken next to my grandmother a few months earlier .
This is me on the same day when I took the picture above .
My friend went with me .
This is me at a sleep party a few days before taking photos for the French Vogue .
This is me with the football team in magazine V.
And this is me now .
I expect that you see out -- the pictures on the air are not my pictures .
It &apos;s images built up , and it &apos;s built up by a bunch of experts , hair stylists , makeup professionals , photographers , and style creators and all their assistants , pre-production stitches , and post-production , and they make this here . It &apos;s not me .
The next question I was asked by many people was : &quot; What were you given for free ? &quot;
I have a lot of 20-centimeter heels that I never wear , which is the exception at the moment , but the free things that I get are things that I have in real life , and those are things that we don &apos;t want to mention .
I grew up in Cambridge , and I went to the store one time , and I forgot to bring money and they gave me a bra for free .
When I was a teenager , I was in a car with a friend who was a very scary driver and she got over the red light , we were caught stopping , and all I did was say , &quot; Sorry uncle policeman &quot; , and we were able to go on .
I got those for free because of my appearance , not because of who I am , and there are people who are willing to spend a lot of money on their appearance , and not because of who they are .
I live in New York , and this past year , of 140 thousand teenagers arrested and searched , 86 percent were black and Latino , the majority of them young teenagers .
In New York , there are only 177 thousand blacks and Latinos , so for them , the question is not &quot; Am I arrested ? &quot;
which is &quot; How many times and when will I be arrested ? &quot;
When I prepared for this talk , I found that 53 percent of 13-year-old girls in America dislike their bodies , and that figure came to 78 percent when they were 17 .
The last question that people asked me was : &quot; What does it feel like being a model ? &quot;
I think the one they want to hear is &quot; If you were a little thinner , and your hair was shitter , you would be so happy and so happy &quot; .
And when we &apos;re behind chicken wings , we give the sort of answer like ,
&quot; It &apos;s amazing to travel , and to work with creative , inspiring and passionate people &quot; .
And those are facts , but that &apos;s only half , because what we never say in front of a lens , what I never say in front of a lens , is : &quot; I am insecure &quot; .
I was insecure because I had to think about my image every day .
And do you guys ever ask yourself , &quot; If my thighs were wider and my hair shitter , so would I be happier ? &quot;
You just need to meet a bunch of models , because they have the tastiest legs , the happiest hair , and wear the most beautiful clothes , and they can be the most insecure women on this planet .
When I wrote this speech , it felt very hard for me to find a true balance , because on the one hand , I felt very uncomfortable coming here to say &quot; I got all this because I was blessed by luck , &quot; and also felt really uncomfortable to go next with the sentence &quot; but it always didn &apos;t make me happy . &quot;
But mostly it &apos;s hard to dismantle a legacy of gender and ethnic issues while I am one of the biggest beneficiaries .
But I &apos;m also thrilled and honored to be here I think it &apos;s lucky that I came before 10 , 20 or 30 years passed , and I &apos;ve worked with many companies in my career , because then I probably won &apos;t be able to tell how I got my first job , or perhaps I won &apos;t talk about how I got my school fees , which seems so important right now .
If something sticks in this conversation , I hope it &apos;s that we all feel more comfortable admitting the power of images in our perception of success and failure .
Thank you .
There are many ways that people around us can help improve our lives
We don &apos;t touch each other around , so there &apos;s a lot of cleverness that is never known , even though we share public spaces together .
So the last few years , I &apos;ve been trying many ways to share more with my neighbors in public spaces , using simple tools like stickers , perforated paper and chalk .
And these projects came from questions I asked , like , how much does my neighbor pay for their apartments ?
How do we borrow and borrow more things without knocking on each other's doors at bad times?
How do we share more of our memories of abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
And how do we share more of our hopes for empty facade stores , so that our communities can reflect our needs and dreams now ?
Right now , I live in New Orleans , and I am in love with New Orleans ,
My soul was always soothed by the huge living oaks , glossing over those who were in love , the drunks and the daydreamers for hundreds of years , and I trusted the city that always made room for music .
I feel like every time someone chirps , New Orleans has a whole parade .
The city has some of the most beautiful structures in the world , but it also has the largest number of abandoned values in America .
I live near this house , and I thought how I could make it a better place for my neighborhood , and I also thought about something that could change my life forever .
In 2009 , I lost someone I deeply loved .
Her name was Joan , and she was a mother to me , and her death was unexpected and unforeseen .
And I thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deeply grateful for the times I had , and gave clarity to things that made sense for my life now .
But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life .
I feel like it &apos;s easy to grasp day by day , and forget what really means to you .
So with the help of old and new friends , I turned one side of this abandoned building into a giant chalkboard and molded it with a fill-in-fill : &quot; Before I die , I want ... &quot; so that anyone passing by could pick up a piece of chalk , reflect their life , and share their personal aspirations in public spaces .
I didn &apos;t know what to look forward to from this test , but the next day , the wall was completely covered , and it kept growing .
And I want to share a few things about what people write on that wall .
&quot; Before I die , I want to try robbing . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be danced on the International Day Trace . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be singing for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to plant a tree . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to live out of bounds . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to hug her again . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be somebody &quot;s refugee .
&quot; Before I die , I want to be completely myself . &quot;
So this neglected space became an architectural space , and people &apos;s hopes and dreams made me laugh , tear , and they comforted me throughout my difficult times .
It &apos;s about knowing that you &apos;re not alone .
It &apos;s about understanding the people around us in new and bright ways .
It &apos;s about creating space for reflection and contemplation , and remembering that what really means most to us when we grow up and change .
I did this project last year , and started receiving hundreds of letters from enthusiasts who wanted to make a wall in their communities , so the central neighborhood colleagues and I make a tool , and now the walls are already being made in countries around the world , including Kazakhstan , South Africa , Australia , Asia-hen-ti-na and more .
Together , we showed how powerful our public spaces could be if we were given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with someone else .
The two most important things we have are time and relationships with other people .
In the epoch of increasing our dispersal , this was more important than ever to figure out how to maintain perspective and remember that life is short and soft .
Death is something we &apos;re not usually encouraged to talk about or even think about , but I &apos;ve been realizing that preparing for death is one of the most powerful things you can do .
Thinking about death makes your life clear .
Our shared spaces can be better reflected on things that happen to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share hope , fear and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
Thanks .
Thanks
Yes , I do app math , and this is an unusual problem for anyone who does app math , it &apos;s that we &apos;re like management consultants .
Nobody knows what the hell we do .
So today I &apos;m going to try and try and explain to you what I do .
Yes , dancing is one of the activities that people usually do .
We love master dancers of the Lebanese and the Tapping of the Foot you will see later .
Ballet requires a specialized level of expertise and a high level of engineering , and it &apos;s possible that the degree of aptitude for this discipline is linked to genetic factors .
Sadly , neurological disorders like Parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this special ability , as is happening to my friend Jan Stripling , who , for a time , was once a master ballet artist .
Throughout the years there has been tremendous progress in the treatment .
Yet , 6.3 million people globally have the disease , and they have to live in debilitating condition , trembling , irreversible fibroids and other symptoms that go with the disease . What we need are tools for a distinct target to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
We need to measure progress objectively , and finally , the only way that we know when we actually have a treatment , is when we have an accurate method by which to be able to answer with certainty .
But it &apos;s frustrating that with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other motor disorders , they don &apos;t have a biological imprint , so there &apos;s no simple blood test method that you can do , and the best that we have is this neurological test .
You need to go to the hospital to do that . It &apos;s very , very expensive , which means this test is outside of clinical trials , It &apos;s never been done .
But what if like if the patient can do this test at home ?
That would actually exempt a trip to the clinic , and what if the patient could even do the testing themselves , then ?
It doesn &apos;t cost employees &apos; gold and silver hours .
It &apos;s only about $ 300 , To do this test at a neurospecialized American Physicians &apos; clinic .
So the one I want to suggest to you is a nontraditional way through which we can achieve this , because as you see , at least in some direction , we are all masters like Jan Stripling my friend .
Here we have a footage of the seconds the vocal tract is vibrating
This vocal second is healthy and someone is saying , and we can look at ourselves as musical ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all the vocal organs when we make a sound , and we all actually have genes to be in charge of that . FoxP2 , for example .
Like ballet it needs special training .
I mean , try thinking how long it takes a kid to practice speaking .
From sound , we can actually trace the position of the vocal tract when vibrating , When the limbs are affected by Parkinson &apos;s , the vocal organs are upset too .
So it should be in the graph below , you can see an example of the unusual vibration of the vocal tract .
We see all the same symptoms .
We see trembling voices , weakness and fibromyalgia .
The speech gets deeper and more windy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
These sound effects can be really hard to detect , in some cases , but with any digital Micro , and using standard speech analysis software combined with the latest , very advanced machine knowledge , we can now accurately quantify where someone lies in the continuing domain between health and illness using just voice signals .
So how do these voice-based trials compare on their face to professional clinical trials ? Both are not injurious to each other .
Neuroscience tests are not intrusive . They all use existing infrastructure .
You don &apos;t have to design a whole new hospital system to conduct this test .
And both are accurate . But one more thing , voice-based testing has no specialization .
That means it can be done on its own .
Fast speed , only takes about 30 seconds to the maximum .
Extremely low cost , and we all know what &apos;s going to happen .
When something becomes extremely cheap , it becomes widespread .
So these are some great targets that I think we can do now .
We can reduce the logistical difficulty for patients .
No need to go to the clinic for routine checkups .
We can make observations at high frequencies to get targeted data .
We can do mass recruitment at a low cost to do clinical trials , Population-scale due diligence is feasible for the first time .
We have a chance to start looking for the early biomarkers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
So , to take the first steps towards this , we are launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Starter program .
With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe , we aim to record voices in very large numbers globally to collect enough data and start processing four targets .
We have accessible local inhabitants with three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Anyone who &apos;s healthy or has Parkinson &apos;s can call in cheaply , and leave a recording , a few cents at a time , and I &apos;m really excited to announce that we &apos;ve reached six percent of our target in just eight hours .
Thank you .
Tom Rielly : So Max , by taking all the samples assumed to be from 10,000 people going , can you tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
What would you conclude from these samples ?
Max Little : yes . Yes . What &apos;s going to happen is , when you call you , you have to specify whether you have a disease or not . right .
You see that , some people might not do it . Maybe they can &apos;t call up .
But we &apos;re going to take large amounts of samples of data collected from all different cases , and the results that are obtained in different cases is important because then we look at addressing the factors of coincidence , and looking for actual signs of this disease .
So at the moment the accuracy is 86 percent ?
More than that much?
Actually , my student Thanasis , I have to praise him , because he did some amazing work , he proved that this can be done over mobile phone networks too , which allowed this project to be done , and accuracy is reaching 99 percent .
Ninety-nine . Yes , a shred progress .
So , that means people will be able to -- People can call from their cell phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s disease can call , record their voice , and then doctors can check their progress , see their health conditions during pregnancy .
Exactly .
Thank you very much . What Max Little Breeze everybody .
Thanks much , Tom .
I live in the Middle South .
This is the Middle South : liquor stores , fast food , moorland .
So the city planners met together , and they decided to change the name South Central so it would have a different meaning . So they changed to South Los Langeles region , as if it would solve the troubles that were really going on in the city .
This is Southern Los Angeles .
Wine shop , fast food , moorland .
Just like 26.5 million other Americans , I live in a food desert . Southern Central Los Angeles , the house of a roadside fast food counter , and accident sticks and then run away .
What &apos;s interesting is that roadside fast food is killing more people , causing accidents and then running away .
In Southern Central Los Angeles , people are dying of cureable diseases .
For example , obesity rates in my region are five times higher than in Beverly Hills , for example , which is about 16 kilometers away .
I get fed up watching this go on .
And I wondered , how do you feel when there &apos;s no healthful food , when every time you go out your door you have to see the bad effects that the food system now has on where you live ?
I see wheelchairs being sold just like old ones .
I see filtration centers growing as much as Starbucks .
And I realized that had to end .
I realized that the main problem was the solution .
Food is the problem , and food is the solution as well .
With me , I also get tired of having to drive 45 minutes just to buy a non-infested apple of pesticides .
What I did was plant a food forest in front of my house .
It &apos;s on a strip of land we call a walkway .
It &apos;s over 3m wide , 50m long .
The problem is , that land belongs to the city .
But you have to look and hold it .
So I thought , &quot; Absolutely . I can do what I want to do , because it &apos;s my responsibility and I have to look after it . &quot;
And this is how I look at keeping that land .
I joined my team , L.A. Green Pieces , we came together and we started planting the food forest : fruit trees , you know , all nine vegetables .
We &apos;re a group that takes share as remuneration , of gardeners from many different lives , from everywhere in the city , and they &apos;re completely voluntary , and everything we do is free .
And the garden piece , it was very beautiful .
Then then there are people lamenting .
The city came to see me , and essentially gave me a dispatch , asking me to demolish the garden . That dispatch later became a court warrant .
And I was as if : &quot; Hey , what ? &quot;
A subpoena for planting trees on land that people don &apos;t care about at all ? &quot;
And I said that : &quot; Okay . Bring here . &quot;
Because this time it wasn &apos;t going anywhere .
Then the L.A. Times got the news , Steve Lopez wrote an article about it , and tabled with the councilor . then one of the members of Green Pieces submitted a petition on Change.org. and with 900 signatures , we succeeded .
We had a victory in hand .
That councilor even called up and said they endorsed and liked the thing that we were doing .
I mean , hey , why not ?
L.A. leads America in terms of the amount of wasteland the city owns .
They own 42 square kilometers of abandoned land .
The equivalent of 20 times Central Park ,
Enough to grow 725 million tomato plants .
How can they disagree ?
Growing a tree will give you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
When the amount of green beans costs $1 gives you the equivalent of 75 dollars .
That &apos;s my faith , when I tell people , grow your own food .
Growing food for myself is like printing money on itself .
I have heritage in the South Central region .
I grew up there . I raised my sons there .
And I refused to be part of this created reality , which was created for me by some other people . And I was creating reality for myself .
I am an artist .
Gardening is my art . I plant my work .
Just like a painter , who embellishs walls , I , I embellish lawns , walkways .
I use the garden piece , the soil planted as a cloth sheet , and the plants and trees are what I embellish that cloth .
You &apos;ll be surprised by what the land can do if you turn them into cloth .
You can &apos;t imagine how amazing sunflowers are and how they affect people .
So what happened ?
I watched my garden become an educational tool , a tool for the transformation of the land I lived on .
To change communities , you have to change the composition of the land .
We are land .
You &apos;ll be surprised to see the way that the children are affected .
Gardening is the most therapeutic and the most challenging job you can do , especially in the inner city .
With it , you get brides too .
I remember one time , there was a mother and daughter coming , it was about 10 : 30 p.m. , and they were in my garden . Then I went out and they were embarrassed .
I thought , oh my gosh , I felt so bad because they were there . and I told them that , two people know , there &apos;s no need to do so .
This garden that &apos;s on the road has its reasons .
I feel ashamed to see someone so close to me that he &apos;s still hungry . And that just further reinforces the reason for me to do this . People ask me , &quot; Fin , don &apos;t you fear that people will steal your food ? &quot;
I replied , &quot; Of course not , I am not afraid they will steal .
So they &apos;re new on the road .
The whole idea is that .
I want them to get them , but at the same time , I want them to get their health back . &quot;
There was another time when I was gardening at a homeless area in central Los Angeles .
There were several men , they helped me unload things from trucks .
The air was very cheerful , and they shared stories about how the garden influenced them and they used to grow vegetables with their mother , with her before . and it was great to see this idea changing them , even for that one second .
So Green plots have continued to grow about 20 gardens .
We had about 50 people come in to join the digging , and it was all voluntary .
If the kids grow kale , they eat kale .
If they grow tomatoes , they will eat tomatoes .
But if nobody shows them that , if they don &apos;t get to see the effects of food on the brain and the body , they blindly eat whatever &apos;s put in front of them .
I see young people who want to be employed , but they get jammed up with something again ... I see colorful kids and they just go the pre-set path , without leading anywhere .
With gardening , I see an opportunity where we can guide the kids to take on their community , and to have a sustainable life .
And when we do that , who knows ?
Maybe we will produce the next George Washington Carver .
but if we don &apos;t change the composition of the soil , we &apos;ll never do it .
This is one of my plans . This is something that I want to do .
I want to plant a whole garden where people can share food .
I want to take away cargo containers and make them health cafes .
Don &apos;t get me wrong .
I &apos;m not talking about free stuff , because free is not sustainable .
The interesting thing about sustainability , is that you have to keep it going .
I was talking about giving jobs to people , and pulling the kids out of the street , and telling them the joy , the pride and the honour of growing their own food , of opening markets for farmers .
What I want to do here , we &apos;re going to make that sexy .
I want us all to be green-grown rebellors , nextrogen gardeners .
We &apos;re going to change the concept of hydrogen gloves .
If you &apos;re not a gardener then you &apos;re not a nextrogen glove .
Make silk gloves along with your shovel , okay ?
And turn it into the weapon you choose .
Basically , if you want to see me , you know , if you want to see , don &apos;t call me if you want to sit in no comfort chairs and go to meetings where you talk about doing this and that where you talk about doing this and that and that and that .
If you want to see me , go to the garden with your spade and we &apos;ll plant a couple of things .
Hello . Thanks .
Thanks .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya south of Nairobi National Park .
Behind me is my dad &apos;s cow herd , and behind the cow herd , is Nairobi National Park .
Nairobi National Park is not widely fenced off in the southern region , which means wild animals like zebras escape from the park freely .
And so carnivorous animals like lions follow them , and this is what those lions do .
They kill our cattle .
This was one of the cows that had been killed in the evening , and when I woke up in the morning I found it dead , and I was feeling very sad , because it was the only bull that we had .
My community , the Maasai , believes that we come from heaven with all our animals and all the land to herd them , which is why we take them very seriously .
So I grew up with a hatred of lions .
The Masai fighters who protect our community and the livestock , are also very concerned about this issue .
So they kill lions .
This is one of six lions that was killed in Nairobi .
And I think this is the reason that lions in Nairobi National Park are so few .
Every 6 to 9 year-old son , in my community , is responsible for herding his dad &apos;s cows , and I have to do the same thing .
So I had to figure out a way to solve this problem .
The first idea that I got was to use fire , because I think lions are afraid of fire .
But then I realized that fire doesn &apos;t really work , because it even helps lions see cowsheds .
But I don &apos;t give up . I keep thinking .
And my second idea is to use scarecrows .
I tried to fool those lions &#91; into the thought &#93; that I stood near the cowshed .
But lions are very intelligent .
They go to the first day and see the scarecrow , and then they go back , but the second day , they come in and say this thing hasn &apos;t moved at all , it &apos;s always just been there .
And then the lion jumped in and killed the cattle .
So one night , I took a torch around the cowshed , that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
I discovered that lions fear moving light .
So I had an idea .
Since I was a kid , I used to work in my room all day long , and I even unleashed my mom &apos;s newly bought radio , on which day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electricity .
So I took an old car stereo , a measuring clockbox . It &apos;s a little device found in motorcycles , and it helps motorcycle drivers signal when they want to turn left or right . It flashes .
And I got a switch so I could turn the lights off and open .
And it &apos;s a little light bulb from a broken battery lamp .
And I install everything .
As you can see , the solar panel uses to charge the batteries , and the batteries power the meter box . I call it a transformer .
And the clockwork box makes the lights go out .
As you guys see that , the light bulbs are outward , because that &apos;s the direction the lion comes in .
And that &apos;s how light shines towards lions when they come late at night .
The light bulbs go off and fool the lion into thinking that I &apos;m going around the cowshed , but actually I &apos;m sleeping in my bed .
Thanks
I installed it at my home 2 years ago , ever since then , we haven &apos;t had any problems with lions at all .
Neighboring families heard about this idea .
One of them is this grandmother .
She had many cattle that had been killed by lions , and she asked me if I could help you fit the electrical bulbs .
I replied , &quot; Yes &quot; .
So I installed light bulbs . You can see in the back , they were lion light bulbs .
So far , I have helped install seven households in my community , and they all work efficiently .
Now my idea has been used across Kenya to drive away other predators like hyenas , cheetahs , and it &apos;s also been used to scare the elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
Thanks to this invention , I was lucky enough to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Brookhouse International School , and I was really excited about this .
My new school is now starting to help by donating and raising awareness .
I even led my friends into my community , and we installed light bulbs to households that hadn &apos;t reached it yet , and I taught them how to install them .
A year earlier , I was just a little boy in the prairies herding cows for my dad , I used to see gliders , and I told myself that one day , I would be sitting inside it .
And here I am today .
I had the opportunity to travel here by plane for the first time to participate in TED .
My biggest dream was to be an airplane engineer and pilot when I grew up .
I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving Dad &apos;s cow herd and lions , we can live with lions without any conflict .
Ashê rises . In my language , it means thank you very much .
I don &apos;t know how interesting it is to hear your story .
So he got this scholarship . Yes .
Cháu was doing other electrical inventions .
Which invention is next on his list?
His upcoming invention , he wanted to make an electric fence . Electric fence ?
He knew that electric fences had been invented already , but he wanted to make his own .
He tried , right , and he ... He tried before but he stopped because he got electric shocks .
Richard Turere , grandchildren are so different .
We will cheer you up the way you go , little buddy .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
What I do , and what I do specialize in-- my life--has been nailed down for seven years working in Africa as a young man
From 1971 to 1977-- Looks like I was younger than that I was working in Zambia , Kenya , Ivory Coast , Algeria , Somalia , on projects of technical cooperation with African countries .
I worked for the Italian NGO , and each one of the projects we created in Africa failed .
I was so melancholic .
At 21 years old , I think , Italians are good people , and we are doing well in Africa .
But instead , we kill everything that we touch .
The first project , the one that inspired my first book , &quot; Light Waves from Zambezi , &quot; was a project in which the Italians decided to teach the Zambians to grow food .
So we south of Zambia with seeds from Italy in a beautiful valley stretching down the Zambezi River , and we teach the natives to grow Italian tomatoes and Italian pumpkins and ...
Of course the Indigenous people had little interest in doing this work , so we paid them a salary , and sometimes they just came to work .
We were really surprised that the natives , in a fertile valley like this , were growing nothing .
But instead of asking why they hadn &apos;t planted anything , we simply uttered , &quot; Thank God we &apos;re here . &quot;
&quot; Just in time to save Zambians from hunger . &quot;
And of course , everything in Africa is well-developed .
We have very amazing tomatoes . In Italy , one tomato is only about this big . In Zambia , it &apos;s this big .
It &apos;s hard to believe , and we tell the Zambians , &quot; Everybody watch this ease of growing crops . &quot;
When the tomatoes start to reach , ripe , and red , just overnight , about 200 hippos from under the river come up and suck it all out .
We tell the Zambians , &quot; God , the hippos ! &quot;
and the people replied that , &quot; Yes , that &apos;s why we don &apos;t grow anything here at all . &quot;
&quot; So why don &apos;t people tell us in advance ? &quot; &quot; Where did you ever ask . &quot;
I thought it was only every Italian who was arrogant on African soil but then when I looked at what the Americans were doing , what the British were doing , what the French were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , I felt something proud of my project in Zambia .
Because , you see that , only few of us can feed a few hippos .
You should look at the silly thing You should look at the silly thing we gave the unsuspecting African people .
You want to read some book , read &quot; Death Aid Institute , &quot; written by Dambisa Moyo , a Zambian economist .
The book was released in 2009 .
We , the Western aid nations that brought to the African continent 2 billion billion U.S. Kims within the last 50 years .
I won &apos;t tell you the damage that that money has caused .
let &apos;s find to read her book .
Read it from an African woman , the damage we have caused .
Westerners like us are imperialists , missionary colonists , and we have only two ways to treat other people : either patronage , or protection .
Two words are derived from the Latin &quot; pater , &quot; meaning &quot; father . &quot;
Those they carry two different meanings .
Protection , is I treat anyone who comes from another culture as if they are my children . &quot; I love them too . &quot;
patronage , I treat everyone from another culture like my servant .
That &apos;s why white people in Africa are called &quot; bwana , &quot; bosses .
I was like slapped in the face when I read the book , &quot; Baby But Beautiful , &quot; written by Schumacher , which says , above all , in economic development , if other people don &apos;t need help , wear them .
This should be worth being the first principle of aid .
The first principle of aid is respect .
This morning , the organizer of this meeting put a stick to the floor , and said , &quot; Can we--envision a city that is not new colonialism ? &quot;
When I was 27 , I decided to just respond to people , and I created a system called Enterprise Facilitation , where you &apos;re not going to start anything you never push for , but be a servant to Indigenous aspirations , a servant of Indigenous people who have dreams of being a better human being .
So what do you do--you silence .
Never bring a community with ideas , you sit with Indigenous people .
We do not work from offices .
We meet at the café . The pub .
We don &apos;t have any infrastructure .
and what we do is we become friends , and figure out what the person wants to do .
The most important one is aspiration .
You can give someone an idea .
If the person doesn &apos;t want to do , then what then do you have to ?
The aspiration the woman has for the development of herself is the most important thing .
The aspiration men have for personal development is the most important thing .
and we help them conduct their search for understanding , as no one in the world can succeed alone .
The person with the idea was not sure there had been understanding , but understanding is always present .
So years ago , I had this idea : Why don &apos;t we , just once , instead of , go to a community , and tell the people there what they should do , why don &apos;t we , listen to them even once ? But not in community meetings
For me to say you know a secret .
There &apos;s a rhyme in community meetings .
Entrepreneurs never come to attend , and they have no way of telling you , in a community meeting , what they want to do with their money , what opportunity they just find .
So plan to have this blind spot .
the smartest people in the community you never know because they come to public meetings in no way .
The one we do is work one-to-one , and to do that , you have to create a social structure that doesn &apos;t currently exist .
you have to create a new specialty .
A new discipline like a family doctor for business , a family doctor for work , who sits with you in your home , at the rice table in the kitchen , at the cafe , and helps you find the resources to turn your aspirations into a way to make a living .
I started as an experiment at Esperance , western Australia .
I was doing my Ph.D. in philosophy at the time , trying to stay away from that crappy mode of protection that of coming in and telling you what to do .
So what I did in my first year at Esperance was I pointed out the compass on the road , and for 3 days I had my first client A carpenter , named Maori , and I helped him sell fish to a restaurant in Perth , and reorganized the job , and then a fisherman came to me and said , Are you the one who helped Maori ? Can you help me ?
and I help these fishermen know how to work together and sell these fine tuna fish not to the canning factory at Albany for 60 bucks a kilogram , but we find a way to sell them to Japan to make sushi for 15 bucks a kilogram , and then the farmers come in , say , &quot; Hey , you helped some people . Can you help us ? &quot;
In one year , I had 27 consecutive projects , and government people came looking at me , &quot; How do you do ?
How did he-- ? &quot; And I replied , &quot; I did something very improbable .
I shut my mouth , and listened to them . &quot;
So should So should the government tell me , &quot; Keep doing it . &quot;
We did it in 300 communities around the world .
We helped launch 40,000 jobs .
There &apos;s a new generation of entrepreneurs who are exhausted by isolation .
Peter Drucker , one of the greatest management advisors in history , died at 96 years old , a few years ago .
Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before doing business-related work , and this is what Peter Drucker said : &quot; Demarcation is really incompatible with a society and a business economy . &quot;
Decision is death kiss for businessman .
So right now you &apos;re rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people at Christchurch want to do with the money of their &amp; amp ; potential .
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you .
You have to give them security , privacy , you have to be really excited to help them , and they will come , in crowds of people coming in droves .
With a community of 10,000 people , we could have about 200 clients .
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people , a bridge of intelligence and aspiration ?
Which presentation did you clap the most this morning?
Indigenous people , people who yearned . Those were the friends who clapped .
So so what I &apos;m talking about is Business Spirit is where it exists .
We are in the final stages of the first industrial revolution-- with non-renewable fuel sources &amp; amp ; manufacturing , and spit , we have unsustainable systems .
The internal combustion engine is unsustainable .
The Freon line to store things is unsustainable .
The one that we have to look to that is how do we feed , cure , educate , move and communicate 7 billion people in a sustainable direction .
No technology can do that .
Who &apos;s going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? Universities ? Oh ? Forget !
Government ? Shut up !
It &apos;s going to be honors , and they &apos;re doing it right now .
There was a very happy story I read in a future magazine years ago
There was a group of experts invited to discuss the future of New York City in 1860 .
And in 1860 , the group of day-to-day people gathered , and speculated about what shared would happen to New York City within the next 100 years , and concluded unanimously the following : New York City would no longer exist within the next 100 years .
Why ? Because they look at the curve on the chart and say , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the amount of the population of New York City they &apos;ll have to need 6 million horses , and the waste from 6 million horses will have no way to dispose of .
They would be inundated with horse dung .
So in 1860 , they saw this needle-pick technology that made life suffocating in New York City .
So what happened ? Within 40 years , by 1900 , in America , there were about 1,001 car-making companies--1,001 .
The idea of finding a different technology was completely above all else and there were very small factories in stagnation
Dearborn , MIchigan . Henry Ford .
However , there is a secret to working with entrepreneurs .
First , you have to give them security .
No then they will not come looking but talk to you .
Then you have to give them an absolute service , separate and passionate .
And then you have to tell them the truth about business .
The smallest company , the largest company , has to have the capacity to do the following 3 great things : The product you want to sell has to be fine , you have to have a fine promotion strategy , and you have to have a fine financial management .
Think try and see?
We &apos;ve never met an individual in the world who can both make it , sell it and manage money at the same time .
That doesn't exist
This character was never born .
We did a study , and looked at 100 emblematic companies in the world Carnegie , Westinghouse , Edison , Ford , all new companies , Google , Yahoo .
There &apos;s only one thing that every successful company in the world has , only one , which is : No company begins with just one person .
We teach business to teenagers ages 16 at the moment in Northumberland , we start the class by giving them the first two sheets of Richard Branson &apos;s biography , and the job for these 16s is to underline , in the first 2 pages of Richard Branson &apos;s biography how many times Richard uses the word &quot; I &quot; and how many times he uses the word &quot; We . &quot;
There &apos;s never a word &quot; I , and the word &quot; we &quot; has 32 times .
He didn &apos;t start alone .
Who starts a company alone . No one at all .
So we can create a community where there are supportive people with background experience in the form of small-scale business sitting in coffee shops , pubs , and your devoted friends who will do you the things that someone did for them who talks about this hymn someone will ask you , &quot; What do you need ? &quot;
What can you do ? can you do it ?
okay , can you sell it ? Can you manage money ?
&quot; Oh , no , I can &apos;t do this . &quot; Do you want me to find somebody else for you ? &quot;
We activate the communities .
We have groups of volunteers who help the Enterprise Facilitator with their help finding resources and people , and we discover that the strangeness from Indigenous intelligence is like something like being able to challenge the culture and economics of this community simply by embracing the aspirations , the energy and the imagination as if of your people .
Thanks .
Until March , 2011 , I worked as a photo editer in New York City .
We are green creatures ,
hidden in the darkness of the windowless room , and generally avoiding the sun .
We make thinner people , the better skin the better , make impossible possible , and always get criticism in the press , but we also have talented artists with years of experience and a real understanding of images and photography .
In November 2011 , watching the world situation at home , I saw tragic events happening in Japan .
Then , the volunteer organization I joined All Hands Volunteers , for several days went to the scene contributing to the response effort .
I , with hundreds of volunteers , understood it wasn &apos;t possible to just sit still at home , so I decided to join them for three weeks .
On May 13th , I found my way to the town of funato .
It &apos;s a small fishing village in Iwate province , with a population of about 50,000 , one of the first to be affected by a tsunami .
Water levels here are recorded reaching over 24 meters , and going over 3 miles deep inland .
Envisionable , the town was devastated .
We pulled debris from the canal , the trench , the pit .
clean schools , clean houses , ready for innovation and recovery .
We clear tons of rotting and stink wreckage from the local fish processing plant .
We lured , but everybody was happy .
For weeks , volunteers and locals came together to look for one thing .
They look for photos and albums of photos and cameras and SD cards .
It all does .
They collected and handed them over for preservation in places around townships .
It wasn &apos;t until that point that I realized these figures were rightly a very big part of personal loss in these people .
When they fled the wave , to keep their lives , they left everything behind , Everything was left behind .
On my first weekend there , I went to help a displacement center in town .
I help clean hot springs , public hot springs , giant bathtubs .
It &apos;s also the place where the displacement center collected the photos .
This is where the people handed them over , and it was an honor to me that day , because they trusted me to allow me to help them wipe the photos clean .
It &apos;s emotional and eager . Before that , I used to hear it had to think a little bit out of the framework , but only when I really experienced it did the magic happen .
When I look through the photos , there are some that are over a hundred years old , some that are still in envelopes from photo washrooms . I think , as a photographer I can fix that tear and scratch , and I know , hundreds of others can do the same .
So that evening , I went to Facebook and I asked a couple of people , and by morning , I got a lot of positive feedback , I knew I had to get started on it .
We started editing these pictures .
This is the first plate .
Not severely damaged , but the waterlogged spot that colored the girl &apos;s face , had to be repaired with high precision and sophistication .
Otherwise , the girl in the picture will no longer look like her , and surely that &apos;s as bad as having the picture damaged .
Over time , fortunately , many images were gossiped about , , and more editers were needed , so , again , I went on Facebook and LinkedIn , within five days , I found 80 people who wanted to help from 12 different countries .
Within two weeks , I had 150 people looking forward to joining .
In Japan , up to July , we expanded into the neighboring towns of Rikuzentakata , further north to Yamada town .
Once a week , we install our scanning equipment in the previously set temporary photo library , so that people come and get their pictures back .
Older women sometimes hadn &apos;t seen a scanning machine , but after 10 minutes , found their lost photo , gave it back to us to scan , uploaded to a cloud server , to be downloaded by a gaijin , a stranger , somewhere in the world , and started getting edited .
The time spent restoring the status quo is a completely different story , and obviously depends on how damaged the photo is .
It can take an hour . It can take a whole week .
It can take up to months .
The kimono in this picture almost had to be redrawn by hand , or grafted , from the remaining bits of color and detail that had not been damaged by water .
It was very time consuming .
Now , all these images have been damaged by water , engulfed in salt water , covered in bacteria , in sewage , sometimes also in oil , for a long time so they will continue to add damage . So cleaning them up is a very large part of the project .
We can &apos;t edit if the photo isn &apos;t cleaned and dried and renovated .
We had luck with hand-painting .
There was a wonderful local woman who guided us .
It &apos;s easy to cause additional damage to these damaged images .
My team leader Wynne once said : It &apos;s like tattooing someone .
You have no chance of making a mistake .
The woman who brought us these pictures had such luck , when they could be recovered .
She cleaned them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing it more damage .
She also had copies of the photo .
Otherwise , places like her husband and her face , will never be able to be remedied , only to put them close together in another good picture , and remake the whole picture .
When she got back photos from us , she shared a little bit of her story .
These pictures were found by her husband &apos;s colleague at a fire department , between debris over the long distance from where the house had been ravaged , and they recognized him .
The day of the tsunami , he was responsible for closing the tsunami shield .
He had to go in the direction of the water when the sirens rang .
Two little sons , now no younger , her two sons are all in school , two different schools .
One gets stuck in the water .
It took a week for her to find them and learn that they had all survived .
The day I returned the figure to her was also the day of her youngest son , who turned 14 .
For her , after all things , these pictures were the perfect gift to the boy , something he could look back on , to remember the past that had not been colored with fear since that March day , when all life was turned upside down or destroyed .
After six months in Japan , 1,100 volunteers joined the All Hands organization , in which , hundreds of people meticulously wiped out over 135,000 photographs , the vast majority — — the vast majority of the photographs came back to their owners , which is of utmost importance .
More than five hundred global volunteers helped give back to over 90 families , hundreds of photographs that were completely restored and edited .
During this time , we did not spend more than a thousand dollars on equipment and materials , Most of the expense was on printer ink .
We take pictures constantly .
Each picture reminds of someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
They are objects that hold our memories and our stories , which are the last thing we hold onto and also the first thing we go back to look for .
That &apos;s what this whole project means , restoring little bits of humanity , bringing those connections back to someone .
When a picture like this is returned , it makes a huge transformation in the recipient &apos;s life .
The project also made a big difference in the lives of photographers .
For some people , they &apos;ve been connected to something big , giving something away , using their wealth for something else than thin models and smooth skin .
I want to read an email to end this talk . This one from Cindy , who helps with photo editing , sends me the day I return from Japan after six months .
&quot; When I work , I can &apos;t help thinking of each body and the stories that are contained in the photographs .
There was one picture , of generations of women in the house , old to young , gathered around a baby , that shook my heart because my house had a similar picture , my grandmother , my mother , me , and my newborn daughter , which hung on the wall of the house .
On the other side of the globe , in whatever era , our basic needs are the same , right ? &quot;
Thank you .
I was almost 50 meters below 1 illegal mine shaft in Ghana .
The air is thick with dust and heat , and it &apos;s very difficult to breathe .
I could feel the collision from sweat-stricken shadowy bodies gliding through the dark , but could see nothing more .
I heard the voice , but almost the whole cellar was a mixture of coughing and smashed rock with crude tools .
As everyone , I wear an inexpensive damper lamp over my head , it &apos;s attached to an old rubber ring , I can barely look out at the shadowy trunks that stand against the walls of the 0.28 m2 hole hundreds of feet underground .
When I slipped my hand , I recalled the miner I had only met a few days ago who had slipped his hand and fell and lost its way down into that cellar .
When I talk to you today , these people are still deep in that hole , risking lives without pay or remuneration , and often will die .
I was climbed out of that hole , and got home , but they would probably never get home , for being stuck in slave traps .
Over the last 28 years , I gathered material on local culture in over 70 countries on 6 continents , and in 2009 I had the honor of being the only exhibitor at the Peace Summit in Vancouver .
Among the incredible talented people I met there , I met 1 advocate for the Slave Liberation campaign , an NGO member dedicated to rooting out modern slavery .
We started talking about slavery , and actually , I started learning about slavery because I had known for sure that it existed in the world , but not to that extent .
After the talk , I found it horrible and really embarrassing to lack understanding of this cruelty in my lifetime , and I thought , if neither I knew , how many people would not know ?
It started chiseling , so a few weeks later , I flew to Los Angles to meet the director of the Slave Liberation program and offered to help them .
And from there began the journey into the modern world of slavery
It &apos;s strange that I &apos;ve been to much of these places before .
Some places I consider my home .
But this time , I want to see the truth being covered up .
A reservation tells us there are over 27 million people who are enslaved in the world today .
Half as many people were taken from Africa throughout the transatlantic slave trade period .
150 years ago , 1 canoe cost 3 times the yearly income of 1 American worker .
The equivalent of 50,000 U.S. dollars today .
But today , generations of families are enslaved for generations with only 18 dollars in debt .
Incredibly , slavery generates profits of over 13 billion dollars a year worldwide .
A lot of people are fooled by wicked promises of good education , better jobs , only to find themselves caught working unpaid under the violence , and unable to escape .
Slaves today serve for trade , the goods that slaves create are valuable , but their creator is treated as waste .
Slavery exists almost everywhere in the world , even though it &apos;s illegal everywhere .
In India and Nepal , I was taken to 1 brick kiln .
This beautiful strange scene is like going into the ancient Egyptian world or Dante &apos;s Hell .
Surrounded in temperatures of more than 54 degrees Celsius , men , women , children , entire families , wrapped in blinding dust , doing like machines , stacking bricks on their heads , up to 18 pellets at a time , and bringing them from burning stoves to trucks hundreds of meters away .
Damn by monotony and exhaustion , they work silently , over and over again for up to 16 or 17 hours a day .
Without food , time off to eat , due to severe dehydration , urination becomes trivial .
The wind and dust were spreading all over the place so that my camera was so hot that it couldn &apos;t touch the stop-motion button .
Every 20 minutes , I had to run back into the field car to clean the equipment and let them work under the air conditioning recovering them , and while sitting there , I thought , my camera was treated much better than the others .
Go back to the brick kiln , I just wanted to cry , but the native canoe-cratic next door quickly grabbed me and said , &quot; Lisa , don &apos;t do that . Don &apos;t do that here . &quot;
He explained very clearly that expressing emotion is very dangerous in a place like this , not to me , but to them .
I wasn &apos;t able to directly help them .
I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
I am not that country &apos;s citizen .
I could put them in a situation worse than their present .
I had to rely on the Slave Liberation organization to operate in the system to free them , and I believed they could .
With me , having to wait all the way home to really feel the pain .
In the Himalayas , I saw children carrying stones across miles of mountain terrain down into trucks waiting on the road below .
The big slabs of stones weighed even heavier than the children who carried them , the crowd of children lifted them with their heads using a frame from wooden sticks , ropes and cloth .
Witnessing overwhelming things like that is heavy .
How can we create this monstrous thing , spill over lanes like that ?
Some people don &apos;t even know they &apos;re turned into slaves , they work unpaid 16 , 17 hours a day , because their whole lives they just know that .
They have nothing to compare .
When the people of this village demanded freedom , slave owners burned down their homes .
These people have nothing , they die well , they want to surrender , but the woman in the middle calms down and calls for people to persevere , and the field abolitionists help them get their own stone quarry lease , so that they now still do that broken-back job , but do for themselves , and get paid , and they do in freedom .
We often think of sex slave trafficking when we hear the word &quot; slave &quot; , and as a result of this general awareness , I am warned it will be very difficult to work safely in this particular industry .
In Kathmandu , I was escorted by women who had been sexual slaves .
They led me down narrow staircases to the dirty basement , in dim light .
The place is actually not a brothel .
It &apos;s more like a restaurant .
Cage restaurants , as they &apos;re known in the industry , are sites of forced prostitution .
Each had small private rooms , where slaves , women , and boys and girls , some as young as 7 , were forced to decongest customers , luring them to buy more wine and food .
Every bedroom is dirty and dark , recognised by the number of paint on the wall separated by the squeezed plank and curtains .
Workers here are often subjected to embroidered sexual abuse at the hands of clients .
Standing in the nearby dark corner , I remember a sense of fear burst , and that moment , I understood what it was like to be in that hell .
There &apos;s only 1 exit : the staircase from which I go in .
No back door .
There weren &apos;t windows big enough that crept .
These people have no way out , when we talk about difficult subjects like that , it &apos;s necessary to remember that slavery , which includes slavery of the sex trade , also happens where we live .
Tens of thousands of people were enslaved in agriculture , in restaurants , full of miserable servants in homes , and the list was long .
Recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sexual slavery each year .
It is around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The textile industry was also often thought of when hearing about slave workers .
I went to many villages in India , where many families were enslaved in the silk trade .
This is a family portrait .
Black dyed hands are the father , blue and red hands are his son .
They mixed the dye in large containers , and embedded silk in that solution flooded to the elbow , even though the dye was toxic .
My translator tells their stories .
They said , &quot; We have no freedom ,
but still hoped one day to be able to leave this house and go somewhere else where we were paid to dye cloth . &quot;
Estimates that there are over 4,000 enslaved children in Lake Volta , the world &apos;s largest man-made lake .
When I first got there , I went through 1 turn .
I see scenes like 1 family fishing on a boat , 2 brothers , a few smaller kids , seemingly logical ?
Wrong . They were all slaves .
Children were taken from their families , trafficked and disappeared , and made to work nonstop on these boats in this lake , even though they didn &apos;t know how to swim .
This kid is 8 years old .
I trembled as our boat approached , kept afraid the boat would knock over my tiny canoe .
The boy was terrified for fear of falling into the water .
Fractured branches entering Lake Volta are often entangled with fishing nets , and children who are both tired and scared are pushed into the water to remove their hooks .
Many of the children drowned .
What the boy remembered , was that I was taken to work at the lake .
Too afraid of the master , I dared not flee , and because of my childhood of cruel treatment , I continued that down to the smaller slaves I managed .
I met these boys at 5 a.m. , when they were pulling the last bits of grid , but they worked from 1 a.m.
in the cold dark night of the foggy wind .
It &apos;s worth noting that these nets weigh almost 500kgs when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to introduce Kofi to you .
Kofi was saved from 1 fishing village .
I met the boy in the aid ward that the Foundation for the Liberation of Slaves rehabilitates slave victims .
Here I was taking a bath in a well , pouring big shelves of water over my head , and the amazing news was , when you and I sat talking today , Kofi was reunited with his family , and , what &apos;s more , his family was handed out tools to make a living and keep the kids safe .
Kofi is the embodiment of ability
How would you be if there were someone to stand up and change your life ?
Driving on the road in Ghana , also colleagues in the Slave Liberation organization , 1 buddy of abolitionists riding a motorcycle suddenly speeded up on top of our vehicle and knocked on the glass door .
He told us to follow on the muddy path into the forest ,
At the end of the road , he urged us to leave the car , and told to drive right away .
Then point at this faint footprint and say , &quot; This is the way , this is the way . Go away . &quot;
Going that way , we lined up the entrance ropes , and after about an hour of walking in the forest , the marks were already in the water after the rains , so I put my photography kit on my head as we went down into the chest-deep water .
After another 2 hours of hike , the sudden round-up mark ends at the vacant estate , and in front of our eyes lies a clutch of holes as wide as a football field , which are filled with slave workers .
Many women lay their babies on their backs while being mistreated with gold , and waded through mercury- poisonous water .
Mercury is used in the extraction process .
These miners were enslaved in mine shafts in another part of Ghana .
When they got out of the cellar , they were soaked by their own sweat .
I still remember looking at their red , tired eyes because many people have been underground for up to 72 hours .
The cellars were up to hundreds of meters deep , and they carried onto heavy stone bags to move them to another area where the stone was crushed for gold mistreatment .
Looking over , the stone dam site seems full of healthy people , but when looked closer back , there are many more underprivileged people working in harsh conditions , including children .
They are all victims of trauma , disease and violence .
In fact , it &apos;s more likely that this muscled person will eventually be like this one , suffering from tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in a few years .
This is Manuru . When his father died , he was brought by his uncle to the mine site to work with .
When the uncle died , Manuru inherited the uncle &apos;s debt , and was forced into slavery in this mine site for much longer .
When I met , he had worked for 14 years on the mine site , and the leg wound that you see this is from 1 accident at the mine , one leg was so badly injured that the doctor said it had to be hammered away .
Above all , Manuru suffered from tuberculosis , but was still forced to work day after day at that mine .
Despite this , he still dreams of being free to go to school with the help of local activists like the Slave Liberation organization , and determination like this , which shows up in the faces of strangers , fills me with resentment .
I want to bring slaves to light .
When I work in this field , I bring lots of candles with me , with the help of the translator , I convey to the people I take pictures of that I want to shine a light on their stories and their plight , and then when they and I are safe I take these pictures .
They knew their figures would be seen by people out there , like you .
I want them to know that we &apos;re going to testify to them , and we &apos;re going to do anything we can to help them change their lives .
I really believe , if we treat other people as fellow human beings , it will be very difficult to clemency to crimes like slavery .
The figures are not about the problem-and-answer itself . They are about people , real people , like you and me , all of whom deserve the same rights , honor and respect equally in life .
There &apos;s no day that I don &apos;t think of these wonderful people being buried . I have a tremendous honor to meet them .
I hope the figures will awaken a source of power in the viewer , people like you , and hope that power will spark a flame , that flame will see through slavery , for without that light , the monster of prison will be able to continue to live in darkness .
Thanks so much .
